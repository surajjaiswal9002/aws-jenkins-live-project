# Live Project: Automating Code Deployment with Jenkins, AWS, and CI/CD
This project involves setting up an automated process for deploying code to GitHub using Jenkins, AWS, and CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) practices. The goal is to streamline and automate the entire workflow, ensuring efficient and reliable code deployment.

Key Components:
    1. Jenkins: Used as the automation server to build, test, and deploy code.
    2. AWS (Amazon Web Services): Provides the infrastructure for hosting and managing applications.
    3. CI/CD Pipeline: Ensures continuous integration and continuous deployment, automating the process from code commit to deployment.

Objectives:

- Automate Code Deployment: Implement a fully automated process for deploying code to GitHub.
- Utilize Jenkins: Configure Jenkins to manage the build, test, and deployment processes.
- Leverage AWS: Use AWS services to host and manage the deployed applications.
- Ensure Continuous Integration and Deployment: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment, ensuring code quality and reducing manual intervention.

This project aims to enhance efficiency, reduce deployment time, and improve the reliability of code releases by integrating advanced automation tools and practices.

# Run these commands:

`sudo apt install nodejs`


`sudo apt install npm`


`npm install`

`node app.js`

or Run by docker compose
